I believe that I can contribute to your vision by applying my data engineering expertise and creativity to your data processing and analytics platforms.

In my previous roles, I have successfully delivered data engineering solutions for various domains and challenges. For example, at Water Corporation, I designed and implemented multiple data ingestion pipelines from various sources using Google Cloud Dataflow and Beam SDK for a data product that helps business manage AUD 2.3Billion worth of assets. I also automated test scripts and reports to monitor the pipeline freshness, quality of data and validate the business logic for the product cutting the test times from days to hours. Additionally, I established a collaborative repository and platform for cross-project teams to share their work and ideas.

At Visagio, I designed and implemented time and attendance tool for a tier-one mining company (workforce 20K+) which provides better visibility of actual workforce consumed along with future forecast. Empowered with these insights supervisors optimise daily plans saving business over $40M. I also built a terabyte-scale data pipeline with automatic deployment using GitLab CI/CD, terraform, Amazon S3, EC2, lambda, Athena and Sagemaker. Furthermore, I developed multiple mission-critical dashboards using reporting tools Power BI, Spotfire for governmental reporting and regulatory purposes. I restructured multiple dashboards using best practices in data modelling and transformation increasing responsiveness and sustainability.

In addition to my technical skills, I also have excellent communication, collaboration, problem-solving, and leadership skills. I have worked with software development teams, business teams, and other stakeholders to establish solution requirements and design platform solutions that address current and future needs. I have also identified and evaluated new technologies and toolsets to enhance the data engineering capabilities. Moreover, I have provided targeted training and exploration for team members on standards and best practices.

I would love to join Family Zone as a Staff Data Engineer and bring my skills and experience to your team. I am eager to learn more about your current projects and challenges and how I can add value to them. I am available for an interview at your convenience.
